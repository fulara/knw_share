# What is Rust?
According to the [rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

`Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.`

**Featuring:**
* zero-cost abstractions
* move semantics
* guaranteed memory safety
* threads without data races
* trait-based generics
* pattern matching
* type inference
* minimal runtime
* efficient C bindings

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello.");
}
```
